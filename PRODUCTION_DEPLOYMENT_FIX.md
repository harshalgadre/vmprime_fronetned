# Production Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
You were getting "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors because:
1. Your frontend was serving development React files instead of production files
2. The development version of React (_jsxDEV) is not available in production mode
3. Render was trying to run development-focused scripts in production

## Root Cause
The issue was a mismatch between development and production deployment configurations.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Updated Render Configuration (render.yaml)
- **Separated services**: Created two distinct services - one for frontend (static) and one for backend (node)
- **Frontend service**: 
  - Type: `static` (serves built files directly)
  - Build: `npm install && npm run build`
  - Publish: `dist` directory
- **Backend service**:
  - Type: `web` (node.js service)
  - Build: `npm install`
  - Start: `npm start`

### 2. Updated Package.json
- Simplified build scripts
- Ensured proper TypeScript compilation
- Removed development-specific configurations from production scripts

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
- Removed preview-specific settings
- Kept only essential production build settings
- Ensured proper base path

### 4. Updated main.tsx
- Added proper environment checks
- Ensured compatibility with both development and production environments

## How It Works Now

### Frontend (Static Service)
1. **Build Phase**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - TypeScript compiles code
   - Vite builds production assets
   - Files output to `dist` directory

2. **Serve Phase**: 
   - Render serves files directly from `dist` directory
   - No JavaScript compilation at runtime
   - No development dependencies needed

### Backend (Node Service)
1. **Build Phase**: `npm install`
   - Installs backend dependencies

2. **Start Phase**: `npm start`
   - Runs `node server.js`
   - Serves API endpoints
   - Connects to MongoDB
   - Handles Cloudinary integration

## Expected Outcome
After redeployment:
- No more "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors
- Frontend properly serves production-built files
- Backend handles API requests correctly
- Application loads without blank page
- No more 502 Bad Gateway errors

## Environment Variables
Set these in your Render dashboard:

### Frontend Service
- None required for basic operation

### Backend Service
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Your Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Your Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Your Cloudinary API secret

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy both services on Render
3. Verify that both frontend and backend are working correctly
4. Test all application functionality
