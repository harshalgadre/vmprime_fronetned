# JSX Error Fix

## Issue Identified
The "_jsxDEV is not a function" error occurs because:
1. Your frontend is serving development React files instead of production files
2. The development version of React (_jsxDEV) is not available in production mode

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated main.tsx
- Added environment check to ensure proper rendering only in browser environment

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
- Ensured proper production build settings
- Configured correct base path for production
- Added proper host binding

### 3. Updated TypeScript Configuration
- Added `jsxImportSource: "react"` for proper JSX transformation
- Ensured correct JSX handling

### 4. Updated Package.json
- Enhanced build scripts with explicit TypeScript compilation
- Added `build:prod` script for production builds
- Updated start scripts to ensure proper production build

## How It Works Now

1. **Development**: `npm run dev` - Runs Vite development server
2. **Production Build**: `npm run build:prod` - Creates optimized production build
3. **Start**: `npm run start:full` - Builds production version and starts backend server

## Expected Outcome
After redeployment:
- No more "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors
- Frontend properly serves production React files
- Application loads without blank page
- All functionality works correctly

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Ensure environment variables are set in Render dashboard
