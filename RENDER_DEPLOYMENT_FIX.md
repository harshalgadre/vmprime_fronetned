# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
Your application is currently running in development mode on Render instead of production mode. The logs show:
```
==> Running 'npm run dev'
> vite_react_shadcn_ts@0.0.0 dev
> vite
```

This is incorrect for a production deployment. Instead, you should be:
1. Building the frontend React application
2. Starting the backend Express server which serves both API and frontend files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Package.json Scripts
- Added a `start` script that properly starts the backend server
- The backend server will serve the built frontend files from the `dist` directory

### 2. Updated Render Configuration
- Modified [render.yaml](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/render.yaml) to use `npm start` as the start command
- This ensures the backend Express server is started properly

### 3. How It Works
1. **Build Phase**: 
   - Frontend is built using `vite build` creating static files in `dist` directory
   - Backend dependencies are installed

2. **Start Phase**:
   - `npm start` runs the backend server
   - Backend server listens on port 5000 (or PORT environment variable)
   - Backend serves:
     - API endpoints under `/api/*`
     - Frontend static files from `dist` directory for all other routes

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Your Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Your Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Your Cloudinary API secret

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Redeploy your application on Render
3. Make sure environment variables are set in Render dashboard

## Expected Outcome
After redeployment, your application should:
- No longer show "npm run dev" in the logs
- Properly serve your frontend application
- Handle API requests correctly
- Not show a blank page

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs for any error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your MongoDB connection string is valid
4. Check that Cloudinary credentials are correct
