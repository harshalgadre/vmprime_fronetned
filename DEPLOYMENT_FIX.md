# SPA Routing Fix for Render Deployment

## Problem
The SPA routing was not working correctly on Render, causing 404 errors for all routes except the root path (/).

## Root Cause
Render's static site hosting wasn't configured to serve index.html for client-side routes, which is required for SPAs using React Router.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated render.yaml
- Added explicit routing configuration
- Configured all non-API routes to serve index.html
- Kept API routes proxying to the backend

### 2. Updated vite.config.ts
- Confirmed base path is set to "/"
- Added appType: 'spa' for proper SPA handling

### 3. Verified Build Output
- Confirmed index.html exists in dist folder
- Confirmed index.html contains the root div
- Confirmed all assets are properly built

## Deployment Steps

1. Push all changes to your repository
2. Redeploy your Render static site
3. The routing should now work correctly for all paths including /shop

## How It Works

1. When a user visits https://vmprime-fronetned-1.onrender.com/shop
2. Render's routing configuration serves index.html instead of looking for a /shop file
3. React Router handles the /shop route on the client-side
4. The page loads correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. Verify that render.yaml is in the root of your repository
2. Check that the build command is: `npm install && npm run build`
3. Confirm that the publish directory is: `dist`
4. Make sure you've redeployed after making these changes

## Additional Notes

- The typo in your URL ("fronetned" instead of "frontend") doesn't affect functionality but you may want to fix it
- All environment variables are properly configured
- API calls should work correctly with the updated CORS configuration on your backend
