# Blocked Request Error Fix

## Issue
You were getting the error:
```
Blocked request. This host ("vm-prime-ewmh.onrender.com") is not allowed.
To allow this host, add "vm-prime-ewmh.onrender.com" to `server.allowedHosts` in vite.config.js.
```

## Root Cause
The error was occurring because:
1. Vite has a security feature that restricts which hosts can access your development server
2. Your Render hostname (`vm-prime-ewmh.onrender.com`) was not in the allowed list
3. Some components were making direct API calls using hardcoded URLs instead of using the API service

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added `vm-prime-ewmh.onrender.com` to the `allowedHosts` array in [vite.config.ts](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/vite.config.ts)
- This allows the Render hostname to access the development server

### 2. Fixed API Calls in Admin Components
Updated the following components to use proper URL handling:
- [src/pages/admin/ProductsPage.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/admin/ProductsPage.tsx)
- [src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx)
- [src/pages/OrderTrackingPage.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/OrderTrackingPage.tsx)

These components now:
- Use the API service for standard CRUD operations
- Use conditional URLs (relative in production, full in development) for special endpoints
- No longer use hardcoded URLs

### 3. Updated Test Files
- [src/test-api.js](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/test-api.js) now uses conditional URLs

### 4. Verified All Other Components
Confirmed that all other components were already using the API service correctly:
- [src/components/HeroSection.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/components/HeroSection.tsx)
- [src/components/WatchCollections.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/components/WatchCollections.tsx)
- [src/pages/Shop.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/Shop.tsx)
- [src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx)
- [src/pages/Contact.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/Contact.tsx)
- [src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx](file:///G:/NTRO.IO_/VM_Prime/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx)

## How It Works Now

1. **Development Mode**:
   - API calls use full URLs (`https://localhost:5000/api/...`)
   - Vite allows requests to `vm-prime-ewmh.onrender.com`

2. **Production Mode**:
   - API calls use relative paths (`/api/...`)
   - No cross-origin issues since frontend and backend are served from the same origin

## Testing
After redeploying, the "Blocked request" error should be resolved. You can verify by:
1. Checking that the application loads without a blank page
2. Verifying that API calls work correctly (products load, orders can be placed, etc.)
3. Confirming that admin functions work (product management, order management)

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy your application on Render
2. Test all functionality to ensure everything works correctly
3. If you encounter any other issues, check the browser console and Render logs for error messages
