# Frontend Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Frontend is running in development mode instead of production mode
2. Getting "403 Forbidden" and "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors
3. Application shows blank page because Vite dev server is running instead of built production files

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added proper host binding (`0.0.0.0`)
- Configured allowed hosts to prevent blocked requests
- Added explicit production build settings
- Set proper base path for production

### 2. Updated TypeScript Configuration
- Added `jsxImportSource: "react"` to ensure proper JSX transformation
- Ensured correct JSX handling for production builds

### 3. Updated Package.json Scripts
- Added `build:prod` script with explicit production mode
- Updated `render-build` to use production build
- Enhanced `start:full` script to build production version and start backend

### 4. Updated Render Configuration
- Changed build command to use `npm run build:prod`
- Ensured proper build and start sequence

## How It Should Work Now

1. **Build Phase**:
   - TypeScript compilation (`tsc -b`)
   - Production build with `vite build --mode production`
   - Backend dependencies installation

2. **Start Phase**:
   - Run `npm run start:full` which:
     - Builds frontend in production mode
     - Installs backend dependencies
     - Starts backend server on port 5000

3. **Runtime**:
   - Backend serves API endpoints under `/api/*`
   - Backend serves frontend static files from `dist` directory
   - No more "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors
   - No more 403 Forbidden errors

## Environment Variables Needed
Set these in your Render dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## Expected Outcome
After redeployment:
- Frontend should load properly without blank page
- No more "_jsxDEV is not a function" errors
- No more 403 Forbidden errors
- Application should work as expected
