# Payment Confirmation Button Fix

## Issue Description

The "Send Payment Confirmation" button was not appearing for orders with "Full Payment Online" payment method, even when the payment status was "Pending". This was because the logic only showed the button for verified payments or for full payments with non-pending status.

## Root Cause

The conditional logic in the OrdersPage component was:
```typescript
{(selectedOrder.paymentStatus === 'verified' || 
  (selectedOrder.paymentOption === 'full' && selectedOrder.paymentStatus !== 'pending')) && (
  // Show Send Payment Confirmation button
)}
```

This meant that for full payment orders with "Pending" status, the button would not appear.

## Solution

Updated the conditional logic to:
```typescript
{(selectedOrder.paymentStatus === 'verified' || 
  selectedOrder.paymentOption === 'full') && (
  // Show Send Payment Confirmation button
)}
```

This change ensures that:
1. The button appears for all verified payments (unchanged)
2. The button also appears for all full payment orders, regardless of payment status

## Changes Made

1. Modified the communication section in [src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx](file:///g:/gadre/watch%20client/frontend/src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx) to show the "Send Payment Confirmation" button for full payment orders
2. Fixed TypeScript error handling in the same file
3. Verified the build compiles successfully

## Behavior After Fix

- For COD orders with pending payment: Only "Send Payment Request" button appears
- For COD orders with verified payment: Both "Send Payment Confirmation" and "Send Status Update" buttons appear
- For Full Payment orders: Both "Send Payment Confirmation" and "Send Status Update" buttons appear (regardless of payment status)

## Testing

The fix has been tested by:
1. Running a successful build
2. Verifying the logic change matches the requirements

After deploying this fix, the "Send Payment Confirmation" button should appear for all full payment orders, including those with pending payment status.
