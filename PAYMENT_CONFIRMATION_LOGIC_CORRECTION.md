# Payment Confirmation Logic Correction

## Issue Description

The "Send Payment Confirmation" button was appearing for all full payment orders regardless of payment verification status. This was incorrect behavior as the button should only appear after payment has been verified.

## Root Cause

The conditional logic in the OrdersPage component was:
```typescript
{(selectedOrder.paymentStatus === 'verified' || 
  selectedOrder.paymentOption === 'full') && (
  // Show Send Payment Confirmation button
)}
```

This meant that for all full payment orders, the button would appear even when payment status was "Pending".

## Solution

Updated the conditional logic to:
```typescript
{selectedOrder.paymentStatus === 'verified' && (
  // Show Send Payment Confirmation button
)}
```

This ensures that the button only appears when payment has been verified, regardless of payment option.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed the button logic** in [src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx](file:///g:/gadre/watch%20client/frontend/src/pages/admin/OrdersPage.tsx)
2. **Removed incorrect condition** that was showing the button for all full payment orders
3. **Maintained proper workflow** where payment confirmation is only sent after verification

## Correct Workflow

### For COD Orders:
1. Customer places order with COD option
2. Admin sees "Send Payment Request" button
3. Admin sends payment request to customer for â‚¹200
4. Customer pays and notifies admin
5. Admin adds transaction ID and verification notes
6. Admin clicks "Mark Payment as Verified"
7. **Now** the "Send Payment Confirmation" button appears

### For Full Payment Orders:
1. Customer places order and pays full amount
2. Admin receives payment notification
3. Admin adds transaction ID and verification notes
4. Admin clicks "Mark Payment as Verified"
5. **Now** the "Send Payment Confirmation" button appears

## Testing

The fix has been tested by:
1. Verifying the logic change matches the correct workflow
2. Ensuring the build compiles successfully

After deploying this fix, the "Send Payment Confirmation" button will only appear after payments have been verified, as intended.
