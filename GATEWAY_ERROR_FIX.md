# 502 Bad Gateway Error Fix

## Issue Identified
You were getting 502 Bad Gateway errors because:
1. Render was trying to run the Vite development server (`npm run dev`)
2. The application was requesting Vite development files (`@vite/client`, `src/main.tsx`)
3. These files are only available in development mode, not in production

## Root Cause
Your Render configuration was not properly set up to serve the built production files.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Updated Render Configuration (render.yaml)
- Changed to use `npm run preview` as the start command
- Set PORT to 8080 (Vite preview default)
- Simplified to a single frontend service

### 2. Updated Package.json
- Enhanced `preview` script with proper host and port binding
- Added `start:full` script that builds and previews the application
- Ensured proper build and preview sequence

## How It Works Now

1. **Build Phase**: 
   - `npm install && npm run build`
   - Creates production files in `dist` directory

2. **Start Phase**:
   - `npm run preview`
   - Vite's preview server serves the built files from `dist` directory
   - Binds to host `0.0.0.0` and port `8080`

## Expected Outcome
After redeployment:
- No more 502 Bad Gateway errors
- No more requests for `@vite/client` or `src/main.tsx`
- Application properly serves built production files
- Website loads correctly without blank page

## Environment Variables
For the frontend to work properly, you may need to set:
- API endpoints to point to your backend service
- Any other configuration needed for production

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Verify that the application loads correctly
